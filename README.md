# Community Garden

A browser game where you start a garden with your friends, journal about the process, (and discover the secrets of the universe)

Built as part of Hack the North 2020. This was our first browser game so we didn't get very far at the hackathon itself, but we are continuing to develop it!

Completed tasks:
- Room creation and room data storage (via sqlite)
- Basic planting, watering, and harvesting controls
- Communication between multiple concurrent users in one room (via socket.io)

Current tasks:
- Add community journal to each room
- Add more plants
- Implement plant growth logic (in response to time/watering)
- Incorporate SVG graphics

Future tasks:
- Add in-game chat
- Develop inventory and cross system (the crosses should be where the 'secrets of the universe' part comes in)
- Add music and sound effects
